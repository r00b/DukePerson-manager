# DukePerson Manager

### Overview

This is a simple iOS app, coded in Swift 3 usign Xcode 8, that demonstrates functionality for a basic iPhone mobile application.

Through the app, users can view and store information about people associated with Duke University. The app supports storing multiple fields, data persistance, and image loading/saving.

I built this app as part of a series of homework assignments in ECE 564, a class about mobile development with iOS.

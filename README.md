# DukePerson Manager

### Overview

This is a simple iOS app, coded in Swift 3 using Xcode 8, that demonstrates functionality for a basic iPhone mobile application.

Through the app, users can view and store information about people associated with Duke University. The app supports storing multiple data fields, data persistance through NSCoder, image loading/saving, and animation with images and vector graphics.

I built this app as part of a series of homework assignments in ECE 564, a class focusing on mobile development with iOS.
